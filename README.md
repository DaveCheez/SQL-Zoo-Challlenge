# SQL-Zoo-Challlenge
An SQL based project 

Git and MySQL Project

You're in charge of a zoo where you need to set up a database for the handlers to know what to do 

Anything in ** is a stretch goal 

Animal table for animal properties

Cage with cage properties

animals_cage takes in cage_id and animal_id


* Zoo with zoo properties *

* cages_in_zoo which takes in zoo_id and cage_id *

Each table (apart from cages_in_zoo) should have atleast 4 fields. Make sure the fields are appropriate 


Appropriate stretch goal, add a table so a cage can contain multiple animals!


Files needed: 
schema.sql (create table commands) 
data.sql (insert atleast 2x records into each table) 
* commands.sql - Should have a Delete, and update for 2 tables *
queries.sql - Simple queries for each table, make use of the following:

* MAX
MIN
AVG
DISTINCT 
LIKE
BETWEEN *
 
You should create a Git Repo for this project,and using correct FBM 
each dev should be in charge of a specific document.

Requires proper pull requests being used 

Stretch goal(s) 
- Add more tables to join, maybe a showings/feedings table? 
- In your queries.sql join some of the tables together to query the data
